This repository is the Client side to the Keg recipes application. The purpose of this application is to make it easier to look up the recipes through a phone/tablet/computer not a paper binder, which saves a big amount of time for cooks while being on duty in a kitchen.

January - February 2023 Features:

All recipes are pulled from API endpoint "/recipes" to the main page of the application in the form of buttons
Clicking on any button will result in a redirect to a recipe page of any particular recipe
Searchbar with a functionality of reducing recipe list, when typing in a recipe name, to the options that match the values typed into the searchbar
